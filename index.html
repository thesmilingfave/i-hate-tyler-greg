    <h1>Dear Tyler Greg</h1>
    <p> I hate you, You have about 1000 hours on GTA RP, it isn't that fun, I know I have a lot of hours on it, but it still </p>
       <p> is way too many hours, also you think you are cool, when no one actually thinks you are, you only get sun light when </p>
        <p> you step outside to get the car to school, then you hobble like the hunchback of notredam to your cave where you live. </p>
        <p> I do not care what your opinion is on this, It took me about 5 minutes to make this and most of it was writing what you </p>
        <p> are reading right now. Imagine getting rekt by a website bro, kinda sad ngl.</p>
